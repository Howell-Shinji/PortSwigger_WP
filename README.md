# PortSwigger Labs Writeups
These are solutions to the Web Security Problems in PortSwigger Labs.

Lab Address: https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-topics

## Project Introduction
This repository is a collection of my write-ups for various challenges completed on the PortSwigger Web Security Academy. The PortSwigger Web Security Academy is an online platform dedicated to Web security, offering a wide range of labs and challenges that help learners enhance their skills in Web security attack and defense. By solving these challenges, I have gained a deeper understanding of various Web vulnerabilities, detection methods, and exploitation techniques. I have documented my problem-solving processes and ideas in these write-ups, hoping they will be helpful to others learning Web security.

Each vulnerability type corresponds to a directory, named to clearly describe the vulnerability type (e.g., "SQL Injection," "XSS Attacks," "CSRF Attacks"). Each challenge is documented in a Markdown file, named after the challenge title for easy navigation.

## Tools Used
- BurpSuite
- HackBar

## Project Update Plan
I will continue to update this repository with new write-ups regularly. If you are interested in a particular challenge that is not yet documented, feel free to leave a comment, and I will prioritize completing the write-up for that challenge.

## Usage Instructions
- Reading Write-Ups: You can directly browse the Markdown files on GitHub, or clone the repository to your local machine and use a Markdown viewer to read them.
- Discussion: If you have any questions about a challenge's solution or have alternative methods, feel free to leave comments under the corresponding Markdown file. I will respond as soon as possible.
- Contributing Write-Ups: If you have also completed some PortSwigger challenges and would like to share your write-ups, feel free to submit a Pull Request. I will review and merge them into the repository.
